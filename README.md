## About

Project VR Bellows is a small web-based project (HTML-only) that demonstrates a VR-themed component/interface. The repository is primarily HTML assets and images, intended to be easy to host via GitHub Pages or any static-file host.

## Features

* Single-page HTML (no build step required).
* Includes images and assets inside the `img/` folder.
* Ready for quick preview by opening `index.html` or deploying to GitHub Pages.

## Demo / Live Site

If you want a quick preview, you can serve the `index.html` locally or enable GitHub Pages for this repository (there is a `CNAME` file present indicating the repo was prepared for a Pages deployment).
